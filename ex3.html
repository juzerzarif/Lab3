            <b>About me:</b> I'm gonna quote a dear friend of mine here: <br><br>
            Climate change is kinda depressing. I mean it's nice we only had one really hot week in July, but personally I don't like this trend. That's right, I enjoy the humid unbearable Midwestern heat, I like feeling the chills of October and early November weather because we DESERVED it by surviving the hell of July heat. I think it's a good thing to wake up on Christmas morning with a fresh white blanket of snow covering the grass, creating the need for warm fires and hot chocolate. In the past 6 years, I only recall getting snowed in once...ONCE!!!! I might be the only one noticing these differences, and if that's the case I suppose I should suppress these thoughts, perhaps too dangerous, too old fashioned for today's young folk. It's at times like these, deep in "triggered" thought, when I look upon the wise words from the 1999 hit "All Star" (check the date, I looked it up). When our world, filled of overalls, frosted tip hair-dos, and a some guy not having sexual relations with that woman, was about to be wiped out as we know it by the infamous Y2K bug, the prophet Steve Harwell wisely said these words (among others of course):

            So yes, the world seems to be getting warmer, but whether you believe in global warming or not, we've all been in pretty heated situations. In school, in life, or in Stephenson when a drunk stranger walks in your room. Life's hard, but the best thing we can do is bear down, support each other, and make the most of it one step at a time with as many laughs in between as possible. Maybe if more of us (myself included) stopped trying to be the best in the world, and instead worked to do what's best FOR the world and it's inhabitants, I guarantee life on this planet we call home would be at least a little different for the better. Well, I think I may have typed myself into answering my own complaint. So that's how I finish, I guess it's time to swim...
